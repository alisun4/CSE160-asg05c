    <h2>Cozy Cat Cafe</h2>
    <h4>Alison Sun</h4>
    <p>It's late afternoon, the sun casting a golden glow through the cafe windows as you wrap up a 
      fruitful study session with friends.  There's no rush, as your deadlines are far away. <p> You're 
      savoring delicious pastries bursting with fruit jam and 
      sipping a rich vanilla latte. The cafe cat 
      has even graced you with her presence, curling up on your table and taking a nap in the warm golden rays. 
      <p>Life is good. </p>
